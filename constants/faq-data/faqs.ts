        answer:

Our Jollof Pastes are rich, concentrated flavour bases designed specifically for creating authentic West African dishes – think of them as your personal culinary consultant in a jar.

They're brilliant for dipping, glazing, or transforming simple ingredients into something extraordinary.</p>",
